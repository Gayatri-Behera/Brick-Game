Hi Guys! I tried to design one of the most popular game named 'Brick Game' using Java. It consists of a deflecting ball and paddle. The player needs to hit the ball in the right direction using paddle until the bricks are smashed and completly vanished. The game layout is designed using a grid system, where the ball moves within a defined grid space. 

Key Features-

•	Ball Deflection: The ball changes direction upon hitting the paddle or walls.
•	Paddle Control: Player can move the paddle horizontally using keyboard inputs.
•	Grid-based Layout: The game area is organized in a grid for better visualization and collision handling.
•	User Interface: Dynamic game interface built using Java Swing components (buttons, panels).
•	Game Logic: Implemented collision detection, boundary checks, and score tracking.

Key Skills: Event Handling, AWT & Swing UI Design, Java OOP principles, Animation, Collision Detection
